# Governance

## Mission & Vision

**What this means:**
- HIS Stewards owns this foundation
- All contributors are equal stewards
- Collective decision-making
- Purpose is greater than ourselves
- Code belongs to the community, not individuals

## Decision Making

**During Foundation Startup Phase:**
Until the community establishes a formal decision-making process, the director makes decisions unilaterally to keep momentum and move the foundation forward. This is temporary and necessary for initial growth.

**Long-term (Once Process is Established):**
Once we have active contributors and stable projects, we will transition to community-driven decision-making outlined below.
